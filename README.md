# Overview

I made this project to work through typescript and see how it can make it eaiser to write javascript. I was able to learn more about Promises and async functions and how to use them when calling an API.

I used an API from deckofcardsapi.com to make a blackjack game. This currently one plays one hand before reloading

I wanted to work with an API in typescript to learn more about how to use the language and how typescript/javascript can interact with HTML

# Development Environment
I used visual studio code for my IDE. I was able to downlaod a few extentions to start writing in typescript

I used typescript which is a superset of javascript. Used to make error spotting when using libraries, interfaces, and more very easy. I used the built-in fetch() function for my API calls.

# Future Work

- Better Game Loop
- Classes to save state better
- Better use of async functions when calling api
- When fully functioning, make github website to run javascript
